# Activity Planner

Account Manager > Activity Entry > Calendar (view, edit, delete, get weather, view activity details)

Account User > view calendar (activity details & weather)





This is an app that an account manager signs in and is taken the activity entry view. They enter a new activity and submit, going to the calendar view or clicks view calendar to go directly to the calendar view. 
The manager can edit or delete the activity on the calendar or view the details of the activity.
The manager has the option to edit details of activity on detail view.

(Ideally)The user will sign on and go directly to the calendar view. The user can click on a particular activity to view the details of the activity. They can highlight a day on the calendar and view the weather for that day.
Backup plan is to have user plug in city name and date for weather request.

A new "user" can create an account. Then go through same process as a user.
